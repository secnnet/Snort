# Snort Rules

**Snort Rules for Network Security Monitoring**

This repository contains a set of Snort rules for network security monitoring. These rules can be used to detect and alert on various network-based attacks, including SQL injection attempts, malicious DNS queries, suspicious SSH traffic, and more.

**Rule Descriptions**

Here are brief descriptions of the Snort rules included in this repository:
